# Command-line interface

The command-line tool is called `idaes-conn`.
It should work in Windows PowerShell and the standard MacOS and Linux terminals.
It may also work in the older Windows command shell, but this is infrequently tested.

# Getting help

To see available options, run with the `-h` or `--help` option:
```{code-block} shell
idaes-conn --help
```

To see a more prosaic description of usage, run with the `--usage` option:
```{code-block} shell
idaes-conn --usage
```
